# üëã Hey there!
I'm a multipurpose Discord bot, including some amazing features, like **leveling**, **music**, **economy** and **media notifications**! All this and much more for free!


# üìª You like hearing music?
Me too! First you need to join a voice channel the bot should go into. For this use the command `~join`. Make sure I'm not in a voice channel yet. You don't want to disturb other people hearing music...<br/>
Once I joined your voice channel you're good to go. Use `~play` to play some amazing songs (or annoying). The music tracks will be added to an queue, which is played in the correct order.<br/>
You don't link the order? No problem! Use `~shuffle` to mix up the queue. Then noone knows where his favorite song was.<br/>
If you're done with the super mega music party use `~leave` to let the bot leave the voice channel. She then also wants to rest a little.


# üèÜ Who's the most active?
Well, what would be a bot without leveling? Just write some messages and you'll gain experience. If you're in a voice call with your friends, you'll gain experience as well. With a certain amout of xp you reach a level. But don't take it too easy. It's getting harder to reach a level every time!
<br/> You wan't to check your level? Use `~rank` to see your current **xp**, **level** and **rank**. I'll display it to you on a nice image, which you can customise using `~leveling background`!<br/>
If you want to see who is the most active on your server, type in `~leaderboard`. This will show you the 10 most annoying users!


# üîî Ping!
You missed the latest stream/video of your favorite content creator? Not anymroe! Add all your favorite streamers to a list using the command `~notifications twitch <streamer>`. The same works with YouTube! Use `~notifications youtube <YouTube channel>` to get notifications from a YouTuber!
<br/> If you want to see, who you added to your notifications list type in `~notifications list`. With the reaction below the message you can toggle between all YouTubers and Streamers.
<br/> If your favorite streamer banned you from the stream use the same command as you added the streamer: `~notifications twitch <streamer>`. This will remove the streamer from the notifications list! Now you won't be notified if the streamer goes live... For YouTubers its the same, just use **~notifications youtube <YouTube channel>** again.
<br/> You want to ping a role once you're live? Set up custom notification messages for YouTube and Twitch! Use `~notifications message twitch <message>` to add a custom message once you're streamers are live! As always, do the same for YouTube: `~notifications message youtube <message>`
<br/> Keep in mind, that this only works for Twitch streamers and YouTube channels.


# üéÄ Reaction roles!
Reaction roles is a must need for every bot. So how can I set up some? Honestly... It's very easy!
<br/>1.  First write the message where your reaction role should go!

<br/>2.  Then add a reaction role using `~reaction roles add <role>`. In my case `<role>` will be @Male. So I can type in `~reaction roles add @Male`
<br/>3.  Now you can choose between 3 different types of reaction roles:
<table width="100%" align="center" text-align="center">
  <tr>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>normal</td>
    <td>Be able to get unlimited reaction roles. If you remove your reaction your role will get removed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>unique</td>
    <td>You can only get 1 role from a message at the same time</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>verify</td>
    <td>Once you reacted to the message and get you're role, you're not able to remove the role</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br/>4.  The last step is to add your final reaction emoji. Just react to the message you made in step 1!

<br/> Now you added your own reaction role! Just repeat the steps for the female reaction role and you're done!

# üí° I have a cool idea!
