# âœ¨ Myra v2

This version includes the backend for the [almost good-looking :skull: dashboard](https://github.com/MyraBot/Website-v1).
Other than that, this version adds new features and other code improvements. I advise you to not copy code from here. Use the
code snippets to get inspiration on how to do things, but not to just copy and paste in your project. Also, this Bot uses a
very old Discord API version and probably won't work well with the new changes. Hope you can find some helpful things here!
